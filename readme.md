<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
The project's goal is to use the techniques learned during the semester to create a mini-video game. 

In Commuter Chaos, you play as a RATP (Parisian public transportation) controller and your objective is to check tickets of passengers without valid tickets. 

The game has multiple levels that become progressively more difficult as you progress.
## Controls 

The controller is moved using the right mouse click. 
A ticket check is performed with the left mouse click. 

If necessary, you can move the camera by moving the mouse to the edge of the screen.

## WebGL Build 

https://purple-desert-0c9cb9603.2.azurestaticapps.net/


## Built With

* [Unity](https://unity.com/fr)
* [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
* [Sketchup](https://www.sketchup.com/fr)

## Improvement

* Ambient lighting, using small low-emission lamps rather than overall lighting.

* Add levels based on subway stations from around the world (http://estacions.albertguillaumes.cat/)

* Add automatic gates (https://3dwarehouse.sketchup.com/model/4afbd8b88704b0af995425f067333fd3/portique-dentr%C3%A9esortie-2?hl=de)

* Add AI that automatically controls passengers in the case of a station with multiple exits, as well as the ability to take control of this character.

* Addition of cinematics:

  * Zoom in during a ticket check with an animation of the passenger showing their ticket and the controller issuing a fine

  * Zoom out from the arriving train to the game camera's position at the start of the game
